Market Outlook

The market outlook of a job can be described as it's future, as in how good a certain field of employment is to join. For example
since there are so many active teachers and not many open teaching jobs at the moment, it's job outlook is poor since it isn't 
a good field to join at them moment, market outlook is based on statistical analysis. Luckily the market outlook for web design
couldn't be better, as the median of all web designing jobs has grown by approximitly $7000 dollars over the past two years and
many web design job occupations have yet to be filled. There is an expected 20% increase in job oppurtunities for web design
over the next few years, meaning if there were 500 web design jobs, 100 new ones would pop up exept there is much more than
500 total web design jobs. Why is this? Since technology has taken the world by storm companies need their own websites just
to enter the competition that is business world. An example of this is online shopping, since huge companies such as Target and
Toys "R" Us havn't prioritized online shopping they have fallen behind to companies like Amazon who's CEO Jeff Bezos is now
the richest man in the world. The online world is the future whether people love it or hate it, so if you plan on starting
a business any time soon you'll need a web designer.
