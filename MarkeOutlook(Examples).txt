Market Outlook

The market outlook of a job can be described as it's future, as in how good a certain field of employment is to join. For example
since there are so many active teachers and not many open teaching jobs at the moment, it's job outlook is poor since it isn't 
a good field of employment to join at them moment, market outlook is based on statistical analysis. Luckily the market outlook for web 
design couldn't be better, as the median of all web designing jobs has grown by approximitly 7000 USD in the USA over the past two years 
and many web design job occupations have yet to be filled. In Canada there is an esitmated 11,700 job openings and 11,800 job seekers, 
meaning nearly everyone seeking a job will find employment theoretically. In the USA there is an expected 20% increase in job 
oppurtunities for web designers over the next few years which is the highest occupation growth rate in the USA, meaning if there were 500 
web design jobs, 100 new ones would pop up exept there is much more than 500 total web design jobs. Why is this? Since technology has 
taken the world by storm companies need their own websites just to enter the competition that is business world. An example of this is 
online shopping, since huge companies such as Target and Toys "R" Us havn't prioritized online shopping they have fallen behind to
companies like Amazon who's CEO Jeff Bezos is now the richest man in the world. The online world is the future whether people
love it or hate it, so if you plan on starting a business any time soon you'll need a web designer.
