Public Sector
Working for the public sector means providing governmental services such as being the Manager of Web Services for the TDSB (Toronto
District School Board). Being a manager is like being a teacher and a boss at the same time, you need to guide your employees in the
right direction and to do that you need to know your stuff. Since this is a rather high position it's pay is well above average at
a range of $96,774 to $116,116 per year, because the requirments are hard to meet unless you have 5 years of experience in communication
and web design. This type of job is where your programming and Buisness bachelor/college certificate/diploma come into play. This
is the type of job you can hope for after a long career in web design where you'll work with managers in government to communicate
with the public by updating the TDSB website or creating a new one. As a manager you will make sure deadlines are met, track and
analyze monthly traffic statistics, create new budget plans and innovative technology. This job is ment for people who want to take
on a large amount of responsability, controlling a whole district school boards communication, are you up for the challenge?
