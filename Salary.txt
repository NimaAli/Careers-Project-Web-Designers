Salary

Being a web designer is great since unlike jobs such as plumming or working at McDonalds, a web designer can revisit his or her
work. They can see how far they've come, show their work to friends and/or family or use their skills for fun personal projects 
and it doesn't hurt that it payes well. The average salary of a web designer ranges from $62,791 to $83,819 in Canada, with
experienced webmasters earning even more than that. The median salary of a web designer is $73,347 in the USA and it's predicted
to get even higher. This salary is enough to pay off any tuition loans you might have and you could potentially start a family
with it. Taking the market outlook into account, web design is an amazing career path and anyone who wants to pursue a career
in programming should give it a thought.
